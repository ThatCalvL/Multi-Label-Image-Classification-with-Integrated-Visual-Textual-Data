# Multi-Label-Image-Classification-with-Integrated-Visual-Textual-Data
This study examines multi-label image classification challenges within a Kagle competition context, employing two distinct neural network architectures: the CLIP model, utilizing a transformer-based ap- proach for integrating visual and textual data, and a hybrid model that combines GoogLeNet with LSTM to process image features alongside sequential text. The dataset, characterized by significant class im- balance, is addressed through sophisticated preprocessing techniques, the implementation of Focal Loss, and strategic data resampling to enhance model training.
Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the CLIP model in terms of precision and valida- tion accuracy. This model’s success can be attributed to its ability to generalize effectively from diverse and extensive pre-training on internet-sourced data, which is essential given the multimodal nature and imbalance present in the dataset. The CLIP model’s dual encoding capability efficiently handles both visual and textual inputs, providing a robust framework for understanding complex data interactions.
Additionally, the research highlights the critical role of precise model selection, advanced data pre- processing, and the optimization of loss functions and optimizers in improving performance in multi-label classification tasks. By leveraging textual information to refine visual data classification, the study ad- vances computational tools and strategies, ensuring higher predictive accuracy and robustness in handling real-world data complexities.
